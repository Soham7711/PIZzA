The average slice of pizza has 12 grams of protein, according to Chelsey Amer, a registered dietitian. Pizza can help you absorb Lycopene, an antioxidant found in brightly-colored fruits and vegetables, that may lower blood pressure rates. Fresh vegetables are one of the healthiest pizza toppings, according to Amer.

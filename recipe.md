1. Start with a crust. A wide range of pizza crust mixes, pre-made crusts and refrigerated doughs are available. Try a whole-grain crust to get the benefits of fiber and a range of vitamins and minerals. Or try making minipizzas with pita bread, English muffin halves, bagel halves, lovash or naan as the base. Gluten-free and vegetarian crust options are available, too.

2. Add a sauce. Go light on the sauce to avoid a soggy rust. You can use the old standby tomato-based pizza auce, such as the provided recipe, or another sauce, such as:

Alfredo sauce 
Pesto (made of basil,
Asian peanut sauce olive oil and other
Barbecue sauce ingredients)
Hummus (seasoned chickpea dip)
Salsa
3. Add some veggies, such as:

Artichoke hearts, sliced
Red, yellow and green
Broccoli florets, roasted peppers, sliced or diced
Carrots, shredded
Spinach leaves
Mushrooms, sliced
Onion, diced
Tomatoes, diced
4. Try some fruit on your pizza, such as:

Apples, thinly sliced
Pears, thinly sliced
Mango, thinly sliced
Pineapple chunks
5. Add some protein, such as:

Bacon, cooked, drained and crumbled
Ground beef, cooked and drained
Black or white beans 
Ham, cubed or sliced
Chicken, grilled 
Italian sausage, cooked and drained
Crab meat cooked and drained
Egg, hard-cooked and chopped
Pork, shredded
Shrimp
6. Add cheese. Mozzarella is the typical pizza topper, but be adventuresome and explore the range of cheese options, such as adding a sprinkle of:

Cheddar
Havarti
Swiss
Feta
Parmesan
7. Bake your creation in a hot oven (450 F or above). Adjust your baking time, depending on the number of toppings. Consider baking your pizza on a grill to impart a smoky, grilled flavor.
